Projects in the 4-Month Roadmap

In the roadmap we built, you’ll complete 4 major projects (+ optional extras):

✅ Core Projects

High-Scale E-Commerce Database

Full schema: products, users, carts, payments, inventory.

Queries: sales analytics, top customers, low-stock alerts.

Add indexes, normalization/denormalization showcase.

Bonus: build ER diagram + schema docs.

Real-Time Analytics Pipeline

PostgreSQL + Kafka (streaming) + Spark (batch).

Store streaming events (clicks, orders).

Dashboard queries for real-time analytics.

Shows modern data engineering + DB integration.

Distributed Social Media Feed

Schema for posts, likes, comments, follows.

Optimized for fast writes + personalized feed queries.

Sharding + replication strategy documented.

DB Benchmarking Tool

Compare MySQL vs PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for same workload.

Document performance trade-offs (reads, writes, indexing).

Shows you understand system internals & trade-offs.

⭐ Optional Mini Projects (Good fillers)

Hospital Management DB → scheduling, doctors, patients, billing.

Gym DB (you already started) → members, staff, equipment, attendance.

Library DB → books, loans, fines, author analytics.

These mini projects are great as warm-ups or to show breadth.

🔹 2. What Your Final Portfolio Will Look Like by January
🎯 GitHub

A dedicated repository: dbms-journey-2024 (document your 4-month roadmap).

Subfolders:

/projects/ecommerce-db

/projects/analytics-pipeline

/projects/social-feed

/projects/db-benchmarking

Each with:

SQL schema scripts + ER diagrams.

README with problem statement, design decisions, screenshots.

Example queries + optimization notes.

Plus: /leetcode-solutions/ and /hackerrank-solutions/.

Commit daily/weekly so your GitHub heatmap glows 🌱.

🎯 LeetCode

SQL50 (done in Month 1) + advanced free problems.

Aim: 200+ problems total across SQL + Algorithms (shows consistency).

Public profile linked on resume.

🎯 HackerRank

SQL Gold badge.

Python/Java badge (optional, if you solve algo problems).

Profile link on resume.

🎯 Projects (Portfolio-Ready)

3–4 production-quality database projects (see list above).

Hosted ER diagrams & schema documentation.

If possible → deploy small demo apps (social feed, e-commerce backend API).

🎯 Extras to Make You “No-Miss”

These are differentiators beyond the roadmap that make recruiters stop scrolling:

Blog/LinkedIn Documentation

Weekly posts:
“What I learned about query optimization this week”
“How I benchmarked MySQL vs PostgreSQL”

Builds credibility & personal brand.

SQL Cheat Sheet / Guide (PDF)

Summarize your Month 1–2 learnings.

Share on GitHub + LinkedIn.

People love it → builds authority.

Resume Projects Section

Clearly highlight database-focused projects (not generic apps).

Show impact + scale:

“Designed e-commerce DB supporting 1M products with optimized queries achieving 10x speedup using indexing.”

Mock Interviews / System Design Prep

Practice DB schema/system design interview problems.

Document in GitHub /interview-prep/.

🔹 3. By January, Your Portfolio Will Show:

✅ Strong theory (ER diagrams, normalization, transactions).

✅ Practical skills (200+ LeetCode, HackerRank SQL Gold).

✅ Hands-on projects (4 solid DB projects).

✅ Brand presence (GitHub heatmap + LinkedIn posts).

✅ Confidence for interviews (system design + SQL optimization).
